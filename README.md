================

The epidemia package allows researchers to flexibly specify and fit
Bayesian epidemiological models in the style of [Flaxman et
al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7). The
package leverages Râ€™s formula interface to parameterize the time-varying
reproduction rate as a function of covariates. Multiple populations can
be modeled simultaneously with hierarchical models. The design of the
package has been inspired by, and has borrowed from,
[rstanarm](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/) (Goodrich et al. 2020).
epidemia uses [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/) (Stan Development Team
2020) as the backend for fitting models.
