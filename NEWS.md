## epidemia 1.0.0
* First version submitted to CRAN
* Bug fixed for latent infections and first Rt with pop_adjust
* reorganized files to correctly attribute copyright.
* New model for adding vaccination adjustments
* latent infections switched to normal, from log-normal
* Additional vignettes and model description
* Additional noise options for infection process 
* Significantly more flexible modeling of seeding process
* Many small bug fixes

## epidemia 0.7.0
* Changes to general interface - new epiinf() function for representing infection model
* Improved package website, with better description of the model and examples in the vignettes.
* Ability to model latent infections explicitly - replacing renewal equation
* Removed 'pop' and replaced with column of susceptibles in dataframe. 
This allows susceptible population to reduce over time due to vaccinations.
* Improved error checking in epim(), with more informative messages
* scaled_logit for epiobs
* Full integration with Bayesplot package, and a plot.epimodel method which 
easily allows the user to choose different components of the model.
* Fixed bug which meant "fullrank" was actually using "meanfield"
* Ability to use random walks in the epiobs models
* Choose between identity, scaled logit, and log link for epirt
* Plot the (potentially transformed) linear predictors for both epiobs and epirt
* Additional families for epiobs - normal and lognormal
* Add summary method and printing for epimodel objects
* Plots improved, allowing step for plot_rt, and improved formatting

## epidemia 0.6.0
* Substantial changes to interface: Added epirt and epiobs objects
* Different and more flexible observation models
* Improved structure to epimodel objects
* Refactoring of main epim function
* Improved plots, including interactive plots using plotly
* Forecast evaluation using coverage and different metrics
* Ability to do an initial run fit to cumulatives within epim
* Updated tests, documentation and vignettes

## epidemia 0.5.3
* Improved model description in introduction vignette

## epidemia 0.5.2
* Passes R CMD Check with no warnings
* Updated installation instructions

## epidemia 0.5.1
* Renamed stan files to avoid errors with Rstan 2.12.
* Plotting vignette

## epidemia 0.5.0
* Random walk terms parsed separately as input to stan files. Variance parameter sampled in stan, and so can make predictions.
* pseudo-log scales for `plot_infections` and `plot_observations`
* control over date range for all plots
* option to plot smoothed Rt in `plot_rt`

## epidemia 0.4.0
* Features for counterfactual analysis and predictions

## epidemia 0.3.3
* Added vignette describing priors
* Description of collinearity issues in 'resolving problems' vignette
* Form for potential beta testers

## epidemia 0.3.2
* Citation file
* Fixes to documentation in website

## epidemia 0.3.1
* Website fixes
* Separate index for website and github

## epidemia 0.3.0
* Website and more extensive vignettes

## epidemia 0.2.0
* Initial version.
